## Overview
The project is mainly written in Python 3.6. I used pandas and numpy for data analysis, and used seaborn, and matplotlib for data visualization.

Each trip is anonymized and includes:

* Trip Duration (seconds)

* Start Time and Date

* End Time and Date

* Start Station ID

* Start Station Name

* End Station ID

* End Station Name

* End Station Latitude

* End Station Longitude

* Bike ID

* User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)

* Member Year of Birth

* Member Gender
